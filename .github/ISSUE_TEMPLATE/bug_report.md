<!--
 - ALL BUGS: upload the output log from Selkies regardless of whether the bug is caused by the web browser or the host. Read the error. If you are using `docker-*-desktop` container, upload all log files in `/tmp`.
 - If the issue relates to `ximagesrc` and therefore screen capture, upload the Xorg.*.log (such as `/var/log/Xorg.0.log` or `~/.local/share/xorg/Xorg.0.log`).
 - If the issue relates to `webrtcbin` or the web browser, upload contents (or the JSON dump) of `chrome://webrtc-internals` and check in the browser console (F12) to see if there are any errors or warnings. In the browser console, check that the codec is supported in the web browser with `console.log(RTCRtpReceiver.getCapabilities('video').codecs)` or `console.log(RTCRtpReceiver.getCapabilities('audio').codecs)` after putting in `allow pasting`.
 - Check your TURN server configuration and see if it is valid and connectable. In case the ISP throttles a certain protocol, try turning on TURN over TCP and/or TURN over TLS.
 - If the issue relates to encoders or color converters (which includes `videoconvert`/`cudaconvert`/`vapostproc`), explain your setup and driver installation as precisely as possible.
 - Add any other information as you wish.
