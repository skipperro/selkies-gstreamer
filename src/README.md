# Selkies Server

This document outlines the fundamental responsibilities and architecture of this server component, designed for real-time interactive streaming.

## Overview

This server provides the backend infrastructure for establishing and managing interactive streaming sessions. It is engineered with a dual-mode architecture to cater to different client requirements and network environments, offering both WebRTC-based peer-to-peer connections and direct WebSocket-based streaming.

## Core Responsibilities

1.  **Dual-Mode Streaming Architecture:**
    *   **WebRTC Mode:** Facilitates full peer-to-peer (P2P) interactive streaming. This mode manages the complete WebRTC lifecycle, including signaling, media transport negotiation (SRTP), and data channel communication for low-latency interaction.
    *   **WebSockets Streaming Mode:** Offers an alternative, server-relayed streaming approach. Media is streamed directly over WebSockets, supporting specialized, efficient protocols such as `jpeg-striped` and `x264enc-striped` (akin to the `pixelflux` methodology). This mode is advantageous in scenarios where P2P WebRTC is constrained or a simpler, direct stream is preferred.

2.  **WebRTC Connection Management (WebRTC Mode):**
    *   Handles Session Description Protocol (SDP) offer/answer exchanges.
    *   Manages Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) candidate exchange for NAT traversal.
    *   Establishes secure media transport (SRTP) for audio and video.

3.  **Audio/Video Processing and Delivery:**
    *   Captures, encodes, and streams audio and video from the server.
    *   Utilizes GStreamer for flexible and high-performance media pipeline construction, supporting various encoders (e.g., `x264enc`).
    *   Delivers media via SRTP in WebRTC mode or custom WebSocket protocols (`jpeg-striped`, `x264enc-striped`) in WebSockets mode.
    *   Supports dynamic adjustments to streaming parameters such as bitrate and framerate.

4.  **Remote Input Handling:**
    *   Receives and processes user input events (e.g., mouse, keyboard, clipboard) from the client, primarily transmitted over WebRTC data channels.
    *   Injects these inputs into the server's environment to enable remote control and interaction.

5.  **Dynamic RTC Configuration (WebRTC Mode):**
    *   Manages STUN/TURN server configurations crucial for robust NAT traversal in WebRTC.
    *   Supports fetching RTC configurations from multiple sources:
        *   Static JSON configuration files.
        *   External REST APIs.
        *   Dynamically generated credentials (e.g., HMAC-based for TURN).
        *   Cloud-provider TURN services.
    *   Includes mechanisms for periodic monitoring and updating of these configurations.

6.  **Session and Display Adaptation:**
    *   Supports dynamic resizing of the remote display to match the client's viewport dimensions.
    *   Manages DPI scaling and remote cursor state updates to ensure a consistent user experience.

7.  **Integrated Web Server & Signaling:**
    *   Provides an embedded HTTP/HTTPS server to:
        *   Serve client-side web application assets.
        *   Host the WebSocket endpoint necessary for WebRTC signaling.
    *   Supports basic authentication for access control to the web server and signaling endpoints.

8.  **System Monitoring and Metrics:**
    *   Collects and exposes key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics, including:
        *   System resource utilization (CPU, memory).
        *   GPU performance (if applicable).
        *   WebRTC and streaming connection statistics.

## Technical Foundation

*   **Primary Language/Runtime:** Python, leveraging `asyncio` for efficient asynchronous operations and I/O handling.
*   **Media Framework:** GStreamer is extensively used for all media capture, encoding, and streaming pipeline management.
*   **Communication Protocols:**
    *   WebRTC (SDP, ICE, SRTP, Data Channels) for P2P mode.
    *   WebSockets for signaling (WebRTC mode) and as a direct media transport (WebSockets streaming mode with custom protocols).
    *   HTTP/HTTPS for asset delivery and signaling endpoint.

Of course. Here is a complete markdown section for your `README.md` based on the provided settings file. It explains the precedence, setting methods, special value types, and includes a comprehensive table of all available settings.

Of course. Here is the updated introductory text for your "Server Settings" section with the requested additions.

## Server Settings

The server's behavior can be extensively customized through command-line arguments or environment variables. This section details how to configure these settings.

### How Settings Work

#### Precedence Order
Settings are applied in the following order of precedence, with the first value found being used:
1.  **Command-Line (CLI) Arguments**: The highest precedence (e.g., `--port 9000`).
2.  **Standard Environment Variables**: The primary method for containerized environments (e.g., `export SELKIES_PORT=9000`).
3.  **Legacy Environment Variables**: Used as a fallback if a standard variable is not set (e.g., `export CUSTOM_WS_PORT=8888`). These are noted in the table where applicable.
4.  **Default Values**: The hardcoded default in the server code is used if no other value is provided.

#### Naming Convention
Settings are automatically named based on their variable name (e.g., `audio_enabled`):
*   **CLI Flag**: The name is converted to kebab-case: `--audio-enabled`
*   **Standard Environment Variable**: The name is prefixed with `SELKIES_` and converted to uppercase: `SELKIES_AUDIO_ENABLED`

### Setting Types and UI Customization

Certain setting types have special syntax for advanced control over the client-side UI and available options. A key concept is that **any setting that is locked to a single value will not be rendered in the UI**, giving the user no option to change it. This, combined with the various `ui_` visibility settings, allows administrators to completely customize the client interface.

#### Booleans and Locking
Boolean settings accept `true` or `false`. You can also prevent the user from changing a boolean setting in the UI by appending `|locked`. The UI toggle for this setting will be hidden.

*   **Example**: To force CPU encoding on and prevent the user from disabling it:
    ```bash
    export SELKIES_USE_CPU="true|locked"
    ```

#### Enums and Lists
These settings accept a comma-separated list of values. Their behavior depends on the number of items provided:

*   **Multiple Values**: The first item in the list becomes the default selection, and all items in the list become the available options in the UI dropdown.
*   **Single Value**: The provided value becomes the default, and the UI dropdown is hidden because the choice is locked.

*   **Example**: Force the encoder to be `jpeg` with no other options available to the user:
    ```bash
    export SELKIES_ENCODER="jpeg"
    ```

#### Ranges
Range settings define a minimum and maximum for a value (e.g., framerate).

*   **To set a range**: Use a hyphen-separated `min-max` format. The UI will show a slider.
*   **To set a fixed value**: Provide a single number. This will lock the value and hide the UI slider.

*   **Example**: Lock the framerate to exactly 60 FPS.
    ```bash
    export SELKIES_FRAMERATE="60"
    ```

#### Manual Resolution Mode
The server can be forced to use a single, fixed resolution for all connecting clients. This mode is automatically activated if `manual_width`, `manual_height`, or `is_manual_resolution_mode` is set.

*   If `manual_width` and/or `manual_height` are set, the resolution is locked to those values.
*   If `is_manual_resolution_mode` is set to `true` without specifying width or height, the resolution defaults to **1024x768**.
*   When this mode is active, the client UI for changing resolution is disabled.
