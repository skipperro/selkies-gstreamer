Selkies is an open-source low-latency high-performance Linux-native GPU/CPU-accelerated WebRTC HTML5 remote desktop streaming platform, for self-hosting, containers, Kubernetes, or Cloud/HPC platforms, [started out first by Google engineers](https://web.archive.org/web/20210310083658/https://cloud.google.com/solutions/gpu-accelerated-streaming-using-webrtc), then expanded by academic researchers.

Selkies is designed for researchers studying Agentic AI, Graphical AI, Robotics, Autonomous Driving, Drug Discovery technologies, SLURM supercomputer or HPC system administrators, Jupyter, Kubernetes, DockerÂ®, Coder infrastructure administrators, and Linux cloud gaming enthusiasts.

While designed for clustered or unprivileged containerized environments, Selkies can also be deployed in desktop computers, and any performance issue that would be problematic in cloud gaming platforms is also considered a bug.
